# Best Predictive Feature for a Country's Happiness

![]("readmebanner.png")

## Abstract: 
This data analysis focuses on finding which social factor has the most effect on the happiness level of specific countries. The predictive variables considered are Social Progress Index (SPI), gross domestic product (GDP), World Giving
Index (WGI). Using K-Means clustering to find a representative country for each group, a cubic spline interpolation was used to fill in for reasonably missing data.
A multiple linear regression model was fitted to each representative country. A program outputs the dataâ€™s statistics and graphs.

This repo holds all the necessary files for the data analysis.

Run main.py to use an interactive script to diplay the statistics of the representative countries.
