# Question 1

## a.

```{r}

# inputs in single character format or in multiple character format
reading_ease <- function(x)
{
  
  # null check
  if(length(x) == 0)
  {stop("invalid input")}
  
  # regardless of char vec length, parse through each elem and split elem into strings based on sentences
  x <- strsplit(x, split = "[.!?:;]")
  
  # calculate total sentences
  total_sentences <- length(x)
  
  # calculate total words: split words by spaces
  words <- strsplit(x, split = " ")
  # keep nonzero words
  words <- words[nchar(total_words) > 0]
  # calc total words
  total_words <- length(words)

  # calculate total syllables
  # short word rule: if word is 3 letters or less, count it as a syllable
  total_syllables <- 0
  for(word in words)
  {
    if(length(word) <= 3)
    {
      total_syllables <- total_syllables + 1
    }
  }
